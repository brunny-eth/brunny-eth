### I'm Bruno

I'm a technologist on a lifelong learning journey. I've been working on startups for the better part of the last decade as a do-it-all generalist, and I'm learning how to tinker on software projects to sharpen my technical skillset. 

I'm the Chief Operating Officer of [Pluto](https://pluto.xyz/), where we're building applied cryptography tooling for application developers. I also occassionally write long-form posts on my [blog](https://mirror.xyz/brunny.eth) (highlights of my writing below). 

Previously, I studied finance and economics at the University of Florida and received an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. These days, I've curated a personal curriculum focused on a weird mix of basic computer science, advanced applied cryptography, and a bunch of other unrelated topics I find interesting, like longevity, space exploration, and finance. 

I also like to cook (see [my running list of recipes](https://faint-smile-2e4.notion.site/Recipes-08b512690f054e58a760e17305632620)), play golf, and hang out with my puppy Manu.
